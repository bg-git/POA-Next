## 15) Google Calendar Integration

**Automatic Calendar Sharing**  
When you make a booking with Pierce of Art, your appointment details (date, time, location, and booking confirmation) are automatically shared with Google Calendar as part of our standard booking management system. This is not optional—it happens with every booking to help ensure accurate scheduling.

**Optional Personal Calendar Sync**  
Beyond the automatic booking details shared above, if you separately opt-in to sync your appointments to your personal Google Calendar, Pierce of Art may access and sync your appointment data with your Google Calendar account. This additional sync is **optional** and requires your explicit consent.

**What we do with Calendar access:**
- Create calendar events for confirmed appointments
- Update events when appointments are rescheduled
- Remove events when appointments are cancelled

**Your control:**
- You can revoke optional calendar access at any time via your Google Account settings
- Revoking access will not affect your appointment booking or the automatic calendar sharing
- You will be prompted to re-authenticate if calendar access expires

Google processes your data according to their own [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not store your Google credentials—only the authorization tokens needed to sync calendar events.
